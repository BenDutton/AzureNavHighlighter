# Azure Nav Highlighter

Automatically change the color of the Azure portal navigation bar based on the current environment.

## Features

- Generates a unique gradient color for the top navigation bar
- Colors are derived from your username and tenant name
- Helps visually distinguish between different Azure environments/tenants

## Installation

1. Install a userscript manager extension like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)
2. Create a new userscript and paste the contents of `script.js`
3. Alternatively, install directly from the raw GitHub URL:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenDutton/AzureNavHighlighter/master/script.js
   ```

## How It Works

The script waits for the Azure portal to fully load, then applies a linear gradient to the top navigation bar. The gradient colors are generated by hashing the current username and tenant name, ensuring consistent colors for each environment.
